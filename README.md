# social-media-analytics

## Overview

Welcome to the **Social Media Performance Analysis** project! This project was developed for the **Level Supermind Hackathon** with the objective of analyzing mock social media engagement data. The solution leverages **Langflow**, **DataStax Astra DB**, and **GPT** to fetch, process, and provide actionable insights into post engagement metrics.

### Key Features:
- **Data Simulation**: Create a mock dataset containing engagement metrics such as likes, shares, comments, and post types (carousels, reels, static images).
- **Langflow Pipeline**: A workflow that calculates average engagement metrics for different post types.
- **GPT Insights**: Integration of GPT to generate actionable insights based on the data.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Simulation & Storage
A small dataset is created to simulate social media engagement data, including post types and corresponding engagement metrics like likes, shares, and comments. This data is stored in **DataStax Astra DB** for reliable and scalable storage.

### 2. Langflow Pipeline
Langflow is used to build a workflow that:
- Accepts post types as input (e.g., carousels, reels, static images).
- Queries **Astra DB** to calculate average engagement metrics for each post type.
- Uses GPT to generate insights based on the calculated data.

### 3. Insight Generation
With the GPT-powered Langflow workflow, the application provides meaningful insights, such as:
- **"Carousel posts have 20% higher engagement than static posts."**
- **"Reels generate 2x more comments than static images."**

These insights help users better understand social media performance and optimize their content strategies.

## Features of the Web Application

Alongside the Langflow pipeline, a web application built using **React** and **Express.js** dynamically displays the insights:

- **Frontend (React)**: The UI allows users to select post types, view engagement metrics, and read GPT-generated insights.
- **Backend (Express.js)**: The API processes requests and integrates with Langflow to fetch data and generate insights.

## Technologies Used

### Tech Stack:
- **Langflow**: Used for creating the data workflow and GPT integration to generate insights.
- **DataStax Astra DB**: A scalable, cloud-native database for storing social media engagement data.
- **React**: Frontend framework for building an interactive web app.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework to handle requests and manage interactions between Langflow and the database.

## How It Works

### Workflow Breakdown:

#### Part 1: Uploading Data into Astra DB Vector Database
- The mock social media engagement data is divided into smaller chunks and embedded into **Astra DBâ€™s vector store**.

#### Part 2: Chat Input Processing
1. **Prompt Input**: User input is sent to a prompt that generates insights.
2. **Search Query**: User input is also sent as a search query to **Astra DB**.
3. **Data Parsing**: The relevant data returned by Astra DB is parsed and used for further processing.
4. **GPT Insight Generation**: The final insight is generated by GPT based on the combined data and input prompt.
